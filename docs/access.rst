Accessing AQT backends
======================

AQT backend access token
========================

Submitting circuits to the AQT systems and simulators
requires having `AQT Cloud Access <https://gateway-portal.aqt.eu/>`_.
The access key is found under the user "Subscriptions".

For running the quantum circuit on the
`ion-trap quantum devices <https://www.aqt.eu/qc-systems/>`_
you need to use `aqt_innsbruck` as backend, which is currently only
available for partners of AQT. To inquire about access to the quantum devices,
please `contact AQT <https://www.aqt.eu/contact/>`_ directly.
